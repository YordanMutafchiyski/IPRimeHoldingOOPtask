1.We create the base class CardBase.cs with a constructor that accepts the turnover from the previous
month and value of the purchase. In CardBase class we also create function CalculateDiscount which is
common for every type of Card(bronze,silver and Gold).

2.After that we create the classes that inherit CardBase(BronzeCard.cs,SilverCard.cs,Gold.cs).
In their constructors we check the turnover from the previous month, so we can figure out what 
the discount rate will be.

3.Then we create the payDesk.cs class that will only contain  our static method for outputing
data on the console.

4. In the Main method we create three object of type bronze, silver and gold.
And we invoke the PayDesk.OutputData method .
